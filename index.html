    <h2>Bio</h2>
<p>Tom is a successful independant artist from Canada with no record label, no publisher, no PR team, 
  no manager, just him and his girlfriend. He writes all the songs and she shoots and edits all of 
  his videos. His main objective is to try to change the mainstream narrartive of rap into something 
  positive. Things that do not promote drugs and illegal activity to minors. Some quotes from Tom I 
  like:
  <li>"If there’s a heart that pumps and there’s a breath to take, then I won’t bite my tongue as long 
    as I’m awake."</li>
    <li>"When you lie to the government they put you in prison, when they lie to us it's called 
      being a politician" </li>
      <li>"I think it's crazy I'm the one they label as controversial, while Cardi B is the role
        model for 12 year old girls"
      </li>
